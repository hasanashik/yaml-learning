# pairs: keys may have duplicate values
# !!pairs
# Normally, YAML mappings (key-value pairs) do not allow duplicate keys. 
# However, by using !!pairs, you can explicitly define a sequence of key-value pairs that allows the same key to appear more than once.

pair example: !!pairs
 - job: DevOps
 - job: Automation

# The YAML parser will treat this structure as a list of pairs:
# [
#   {job: DevOps},
#   {job: Automation}
# ]

# same as
pair example: !!pairs [job: DevOps, job: Automation]
# this will be an array of hashtables

# !!set will allow you to have unique values
