Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide for running the commands to manage the pod and services and observe their various parameters:

Step 1: Deploy the Pod
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
This command applies the configuration file (pod.yaml) and creates the pod along with its containers.

Step 2: Verify Pod Status
kubectl get pods
This command shows the status of all running pods. You should see firewall-pod with 3/3 containers running.

Step 3: Check the Service
kubectl get services
kubectl get svc firewall-service
This command lists all services, including the firewall-service, which should show the external NodePort (30007) and internal ClusterIP.

Step 4: Check the Pod Details
kubectl describe pod firewall-pod
This command provides detailed information about the pod, including container statuses, IP addresses, and event logs.

Step 5: Access Containers within the Pod
To access a specific container:
kubectl exec -it firewall-pod --container container-1 -- /bin/sh
Or to access other containers:

kubectl exec -it firewall-pod --container container-2 -- /bin/sh
kubectl exec -it firewall-pod --container firewall-container -- /bin/sh

Step 6: Test Requests Between Containers
Once inside the firewall-container, test the connection to the other containers:

# Access container-1
curl 127.0.0.1:8081

# Access container-2
curl 127.0.0.1:8082
You should see responses from container-1 and container-2.

Step 7: Access Service Externally
To find the Minikube IP:
minikube ip
Now access the service using the Minikube IP and the NodePort (30007):

http://<Minikube-IP>:30007/app1
http://<Minikube-IP>:30007/app2
Step 8: Check Logs
To view the logs from a specific container:

kubectl logs firewall-pod -c firewall-container
kubectl logs firewall-pod -c container-1
kubectl logs firewall-pod -c container-2

Step 9: Clean Up Resources
To delete the pod:
kubectl delete pod firewall-pod
To delete the service:



kubectl delete svc firewall-service
Shortcut to Get Minikube Service URL

minikube service firewall-service --url
This command provides the URL for accessing the service directly.

Step 10: Reapply Configuration
If you want to redeploy the pod:
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
